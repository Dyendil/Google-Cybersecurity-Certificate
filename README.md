■ A Project Title: A descriptive title related to the project that may
interest your prospective employer. Do not title your project
“Portfolio Project”; instead, try adding a title that defines the
project you have worked on.<br>
■ A Project Introduction: Two to three sentences that state the
problem you solved, the data used for the project, and your
modeling results.<br>
■ Modeling and Evaluation: Name and describe the models you
used for the project and any corresponding evaluation metrics.<br>
■ Conclusion: Your recommendations for solving the problem and a
description of any future steps you want to take to expand on your
project.<br>

<h1>Portfolio Activity: Use Linux commands to manage file permissions</h1>
<h3>Intro:</h3>
Solving the permission challenges where users should have access to only what they need to fonction. Concept of least privilege.

<h2>Step 1: Access the template</h2>
To use the template for this course item, click the following link and select Use Template. (In this step, you will just open the template. More instructions for how to use the template will be included in later steps.)

<h2>Step 2: Access supporting materials</h2>
The following supporting materials will help you complete this activity. Keep them open as you proceed to the next steps. 

To use the supporting materials for this course item, click the links.

The Instructions for including Linux commands document provides instructions and best practices for including samples of Linux commands in your portfolio activity.

[Instructions for including Linux commands](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1t-9o-bPndpOIh9577FJobiakS10kJxgIKrB6GG7EPwA/template/preview?usp=sharing&resourcekey=0-623w2JztdmNSu3nDbsQJcQ)

The Current file permissions document demonstrates how the file structure is built for this portfolio activity. The file permissions for each file or directory are also provided.

Link to supporting material: 
[Current file permissions](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1F3-8XQZsNagSzTkJwFzOGY5OHbGbMRtlb8GbmXE_gCc/template/preview?usp=sharing&resourcekey=0-UUEu0EyFFvMf0SAipcel6w)

Note: It is recommended that you use the Manage authorization lab to complete this portfolio activity. If you’re revisiting the lab, using the Current file permissions document is optional because this file structure has already been created for you.

<h2>Step 3: Check file and directory details</h2>
In the Manage authorization lab, check the permissions set for files and subdirectories in the projects directory. Make sure you display all permissions, including hidden files. Or, use the content of 
[Current file permissions](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1F3-8XQZsNagSzTkJwFzOGY5OHbGbMRtlb8GbmXE_gCc/template/preview?usp=sharing&resourcekey=0-UUEu0EyFFvMf0SAipcel6w)
 document to determine the current permissions. 

Describe the command you can use to check permissions in the Check file and directory details section of the File permissions in Linux template. From the lab, take a screenshot of the Linux command you used. Or, type this command directly into the template.

Then, use either the output of this command in the lab or the content or the Current file permissions document to indicate the current permissions. If using the Current file permissions document, write these in the 10-character string that would be part of the command's output.

<h2>Step 4: Describe the permissions string</h2>
Choose one example from the output in the previous step. In the Describe the permissions string section of the File permissions in Linux template, write a short description that explains the 10-character string in the example. You should describe what the 10-character string is for and what each character represents.

<h2>Step 5: Change file permissions</h2>
The organization does not allow other to have write access to any files. Based on the permissions established in Step 3, identify which file needs to have its permissions modified. Use a Linux command to modify these permissions.

Describe the command you used and its output in the Change file permissions section of the File permissions in Linux template. In the Manage authorization lab, take a screenshot of the Linux command you used. Or, type this command directly into the template.

<h2>Step 6: Change file permissions on a hidden file</h2>
The research team has archived .project_x.txt, which is why it’s a hidden file. This file should not have write permissions for anyone, but the user and group should be able to read the file. Use a Linux command to assign .project_x.txt the appropriate authorization.

Describe the command you used and its output in the Change file permissions on a hidden file section of the File permissions in Linux template. In the Manage authorization lab, take a screenshot of the Linux command you used. Or, type this command directly into the template.

<h2>Step 7: Change directory permissions</h2>
The files and directories in the projects directory belong to the researcher2 user. Only researcher2 should be allowed to access the drafts directory and its contents. Use a Linux command to modify the permissions accordingly.

Describe the command you used and its output in the Change directory permissions section of the File permissions in Linux template. In the Manage authorization lab, take a screenshot of the Linux command you used. Or, type this command directly into the template.

<h2>Step 8: Finalize your document</h2>
<h3>Summary</h3>
To finalize the document and make its purpose clear to potential employers, be sure to complete the Project description and Summary sections of the File permissions in Linux template. 

In the Project description section, give a general overview of the scenario and what you accomplish through Linux. Write two to four sentences.

In the Summary section, provide a short summary of the previous tasks and connect them to the scenario. Write approximately two to four sentences.
